## Outfit Generator

OutfitGen - Created by Dominique Louangrath for ITCS 3112


Working prototype for the program I've been designing over the course of the semester.


UI provided by FlatLaf: https://github.com/JFormDesigner/FlatLaf


## How to Run

Either download the .exe from the releases, or run the jar file. If neither work, you can
download the source code and run the program from App.java.


## Testing

For convenience, several .txt files are available in the /test_clothing folder that load clothing into
the wardrobe.


## Folder Structure (VSCode Default)

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
