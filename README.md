## Outfit Generator

OutfitGen - Created by Dominique Louangrath for ITCS 3112


Working prototype for the program I've been designing over the course of the semester.

## Folder Structure (VSCode Default)

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
